# Link State Routing 

* Implementation of link state routing protocol 
* The program will be: 
	* Run all nodes in the specified network 
	* At each node, the input to the program is a set of directly attached nodes and the costs of these links 
	* Each node will broadcast link state packets 
	* Routing program at each node report the least cost path and the associated cost to all other nodes in the network 
	* Program deals with failed nodes
